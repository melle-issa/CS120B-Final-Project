# CS120B-Final-Project
* This is my final project submission for my Intro to Embedded Systems class. You can find the demo video [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_68-arju9_U). 
* For my project, I created a mini air conditioning unit. This machine automatically turns on a fan if the surrounding temperature exceeds 80°F (26.7°C) in temperature mode or 40% humidity in humidity mode. Users can also turn off the fan if they wish by pressing a button. The fan can be reactivated once the button is pressed again. A 4 digit segment display shows either the current temperature or humidity based on what mode the user has put the machine in. The modes can also be changed with a button press. Pressing one button activates humidity mode. The second button activates temperature mode and switches between celsius and fahrenheit. Modes include a celsius reading, fahrenheit reading, and humidity reading.  
* A copy of my lab report for this project can also be found as well as the source code. It has the wiring diagram, user guide, and task diagram for more details!

## Main Parts Used:
* DHT11 Temperature and Humidity Module
* 4 Digit 7-Segment Display
* 74HC595 shift register
* Fan Blade and 3-6V DC Motor
